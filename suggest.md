### Prefer GitHub?

Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/BenAmpel/DS-ISR-Methodological-Tools/issues/new?template=suggest_resource.md&title=Suggest+Resource%3A+) with the template pre-filled, or submit a pull request directly — see the [Contributing Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributing/) for instructions.

### What makes a good submission?

{: .callout-tip }
The best submissions are things you've **personally used** in an IS or design science research project. Generic ML resources are widely available — what's rare is curation through a DSR lens.

| Criterion | Good ✅ | Skip ❌ |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Relevance | Used in IS/DSR research | General ML tutorial |
| Recency | Published 2020–present | Outdated (pre-2018) |
| Quality | Peer-reviewed or widely cited | Uncurated blog posts |
| Code | Comes with notebook/repo | Theory only (usually) |
