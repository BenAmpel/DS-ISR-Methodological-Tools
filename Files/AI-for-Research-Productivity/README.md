| [Reduct.Video](https://reduct.video/) | Video-based qualitative coding — transcribe and highlight video interviews, tag segments, and export for analysis. | Think-aloud protocols, screen recordings, focus group videos |

- **LLM-Assisted Coding Workflow:** Use Whisper (see [Multimodal Models](../MultimodalModels/README.md)) to transcribe interviews → use an LLM with a grounded theory prompt to generate initial code suggestions → import into Atlas.ti or NVivo for human review and saturation analysis.

- **IS Research Note:** AI-generated codes should be treated as *initial suggestions*, not final codes. Validate with a second human coder and report inter-rater reliability (Cohen's κ ≥ 0.70 is the standard threshold for IS qualitative research).
