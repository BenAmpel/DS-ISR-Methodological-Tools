## The Automation-of-Invention Framework
*Based on the framework introduced in Information Systems Research (2025), AI tools for IS researchers can be classified by their role in the research process:*

| Level | Role | Description | Example Tools |
|-------|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Level I** | **Copy Editor** | Drafting, polishing, and translating research artifacts | DeepL Write, GrammarlyGO, Lex |
| **Level II** | **Research Assistant** | Literature review, data collection, and processing pipelines | Elicit, Research Rabbit, LangChain, LlamaIndex |
| **Level III** | **Super-Collaborator** | Autonomous agents that simulate users, explore theory, or co-generate artifacts | Multi-Agent Systems, Generative Agents, DSPy |

> *At Level III, AI moves from assisting the researcher to actively participating in the invention process — simulating stakeholders, stress-testing theory, and generating novel design alternatives.*
